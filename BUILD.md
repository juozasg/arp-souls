# Odin + Raylib on the web

Make games using Odin + Raylib that works in browser and on desktop.

Live example: https://zylinski.se/odin-raylib-web/

## Requirements

- **Emscripten**. Follow instructions here: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html (the stuff under "Installation instructions using the emsdk (recommended)").
- **Recent Odin compiler**: This uses Raylib binding changes that were done on January 1, 2025.

## Getting started

1. Point `EMSCRIPTEN_SDK_DIR` in `build_web.bat/sh` to where you installed emscripten.
2. Run `build_web.bat/sh`.
3. Web game is in the `build/web` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> `build_web.bat` is for windows, `build_web.sh` is for Linux / macOS.

> [!WARNING]
> You can't run `build/web/index.html` directly due to "CORS policy" javascript errors. You can work around that by running a small python web server:
> - Go to `build/web` in a console.
> - Run `python -m http.server`
> - Go to `localhost:8000` in your browser.
>
> _For those who don't have python: Emscripten comes with it. See the `python` folder in your emscripten installation directory._

Build a desktop executable using `build_desktop.bat/sh`. It will end up in the `build/desktop` folder.

Put any assets (textures, sounds etc) into the `assets` folder. Emscripten will merge those into the web build. For desktop builds, the `assets` folder is copied to the `build/desktop` folder.

## What works

- Use raylib, raygui, rlgl using the default `vendor:raylib` bindings.
- Allocator that works with maps and SIMD (uses emcripten's `malloc`).
- Temp allocator.
- Logger.
- `fmt.println` etc
- There's a wrapper for `read_entire_file` and `write_entire_file` from `core:os` that can files from `assets` directory, even on web. See `source/utils.odin`

> [!NOTE]
> Files written using `write_entire_file` don't exist outside the browser. They don't survive closing the tab. But you can write a file and load it within the same session. You can use it to make your old desktop code run, even though it won't be possible to _really_ save anything.

## Debugging

I recommend debugging the desktop build when you can (add `-debug` inside `build_desktop.bat/sh` and use for example [RAD Debugger](https://github.com/EpicGamesExt/raddebugger)). For web-only bugs, you can add `-g` to the the `emcc` line in the build script. This gives you better crash callstacks. It works in Chrome, not so much in Firefox.

## Sublime Text

There is a Sublime project file: `project.sublime-project`. It has a build system that lets you run the web and desktop build scripts.

## Web build in my Hot Reload template

My Odin + Raylib + Hot Reload template has been updated with similar capabilities: https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-raylib-hot-reload-game-template -- Note: It's just for making a _release web build_, no web hot reloading is supported!

## How does the web build work?

Start by looking at `build_web.bat/sh` and see how it uses both the Odin compiler and the emscripten compiler (`emcc`). Raylib requires `emcc` to (among other things) translate OpenGL to WebGL calls. Also see `source/main_web/index_template.html` (used as template for `build/web/index/html`). That HTML file contains javascript that calls the entry-point procedures you'll find in `source/main_web/main_web.odin`. It's a bit special in the way that it sets our Odin stuff up within a callback that comes from emscripten (`instantiateWasm`).

## Troubleshooting

### I get `panic: wasm_allocator: initial memory could not be allocated`

You probably have a global variable that allocates dynamic memory. Move that allocation into the game's `init` proc. This could also happen if initialize dynamic arrays or maps in the global file scope, like so:

```
arr := [dynamic]int { 2, 3, 4 }
```

In that case you can declare it and do the initialization in the `init` proc instead:

```
arr: [dynamic]int

init :: proc() {
  arr = { 2, 3, 4 }
}
```

This happens because the context hasn't been initialized with the correct allocator yet.

The error can also happen if you import some package that does allocations in a procedure tagged with `@(init)`. Once such page is `core:math/big`. That package is in turn imported by `core:encoding/cbor`. So if you import cbor you may get this error. If you need cbor, then you you can try, as a work-around, to run the Odin compiler with the `-default-to-nil-allocator` option. That may break the `core:math/big` package, but you might not need it.

### I get `RuntimeError: memory access out of bounds`

Try modifying the `build_web` script and add these flags where it runs `emcc`:
```
-sALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1 -sINITIAL_HEAP=16777216 -sSTACK_SIZE=65536
```
The numbers `16777216` and `65536` above are the default values, try bigger ones and see if it helps.

### I load assets from more folders than the `assets` folder
Add an additional `--preload-file folder_name` option to the build script when it runs `emcc`. Then that folder will become part of the web build.

### I can only use `#version 100` shaders
The raylib libraries that come with Odin can only use version 100. That's the default for raylib. But you can recompile raylib so that shaders with version `300 es` works. That's a fairly modern version. It's mostly the same as the common `330` version.

You'll need to recompile the raylib WASM binaries. That means you need to download the raylib source from here: https://github.com/raysan5/raylib

When you've downloaded it you need to compile raylib with OpenGL ES3 support. Something like this:

```
make clean
make PLATFORM=PLATFORM_WEB GRAPHICS=GRAPHICS_API_OPENGL_ES3 -B
```
You might also be able to use `mingw32-make` instead of `make` on Windows, if you have mingw installed. You may also be able to invoke `emcc` manually, but you'll have to look through the makefiles to see what commands you need to run.

You'll need to copy the outputted wasm libs from this build to your raylib bindings, overwriting the old raylib WASM library files.

When building your game, you need to modify the build script. When it runs `emcc`, add the following: `-sFULL_ES3=1`.

You can now use the `300 es` version of shaders. Make sure the shaders have this at the top:
```
#version 300 es
precision highp float;
```

Thanks to lucy for figuring this stuff out.

### Error: `emcc: error: build\web\index.data --from-emcc --preload assets' failed (returned 1)`
You might be missing the `assets` folder. It must have at least a single file inside it. You can also remove the `--preload-file assets` from the build script.
